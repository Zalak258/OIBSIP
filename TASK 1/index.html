         <p>Dr.Bansi  was very caring and understanding towards my children during our visit. My children are very scared of dentists to begin with. But she took the time to talk to them through the procedures and calm them down. She never talked down to the kids - neither did she apply pressure if they were not ready for the procedure.</p>
